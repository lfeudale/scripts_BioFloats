Logarithmic-like smoothing helper object.

This class smooths the values according to the following algorithm:

1. Build a distance vector as long as the current interval based on
   pressure_values and centered on the current sample.
2. Normalize the distances::

    d[i] = d[i] / d_max

   where d_max is the maximum distance.
3. Compute the weights based on the normalized distances::

    weights[i] = exp(-0.5*(d[i] / sigma)**2)

4. Compute the output::

        output[i] = sum((values[(i - interval // 2):(i + (interval // 2 ) + 1)] * weights)) / sum(weights)

Basically instead of weighting the weights it takes different points on the
Gauss bell curve according to the distance from the current sample.

GaussianMean class constructor.

Args:
    - *interval*: the amount of nearby points that the filter has to
      consider for each point of the values' array including the point
      itself. The interval is centered on the current point and an even
      interval will be promoted to the next odd value (e.g. 4 will
      become 5 so two points before and two points after plus the
      current point will be considered).
    - *sigma*: the sigma parameter for the Gauss bell curve.
      Defaults to 1.0 .

Raises:
    - *ValueError* if interval or sigma are negative or if they cannot
      be converted to a number.
