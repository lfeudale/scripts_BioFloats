To plot beavior of single biofloats by dividing also by season, 
1) I count all the profiles in that range of time
2) I select the wmo name of the bio-float
3) I divide the autumn-winter season and the spring summer season for the single bio-float
4) I do the statistics (mean, std, ...... of CHLA, saline, temperature, nitrate and oxigen).
